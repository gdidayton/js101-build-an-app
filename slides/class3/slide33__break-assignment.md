## While you take a break...

Remember those dog gifs we had you save?

- Create an array of objects called `dogs`
- Each object inside the array should have four properties
  - `name`
  - `age`
  - `photoUrl`
  - `tricks`

- `name`, `age`, and `tricks` we've seen before and should be self-explanatory.
- `photoUrl` should contain a link to one of your dog gifs (saved as a string).
- You should create **5** objects.
