## Expanding Arrays

Arrays do not have a fixed length. You can use [push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push), which is a function available to all arrays, to add something to an array.

```
var myFavoriteThings = ['dogs', 1024, 'more dogs'];

myFavoriteThings.push('books');
```
