## While Loops

A [while](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) loop will repeat the same code over and over until some condition is met.

```
let bottlesOfBeer = 99;

while (bottlesOfBeer > 0) {
  console.log(`${bottlesOfBeer} bottles of beer on the wall`);
  bottlesOfBeer = bottlesOfBeer - 1;
}
```
