## Let's Develop It

Just for practice, let's make a simple for loop. You can do this in the JavaScript area of your app.

Write a loop that gives you the 9's times table, <br> from **9 x 1 = 9** to **9 x 12 = 108**.

Finish early? Try using a loop inside a loop to write all the times tables, from 1 to 12.
