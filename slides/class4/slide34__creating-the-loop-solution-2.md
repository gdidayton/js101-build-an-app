## Problem Solving

We can use conditionals to turn our iterator into a loop!

- First, we need to check if we are on the last dog in our list (_hint: remember that the index number is zero-based, while the count of dogs in your array is one-based_).
- If we are on the last dog, we would want to re-set the dogIndex to zero.
- If we are not on the last dog, we would want to increase the dogIndex by one.
