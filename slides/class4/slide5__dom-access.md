## DOM Access

Your browser automatically loads the content of a webpage into a <code>Document</code> object which serves as the entry point into a web page's content.

**Using the `document` you can:**
  - Change the content tree any way you want.
  - Build an HTML document from scratch.
  - Access or replace any existing DOM nodes (HTML elements in the DOM).
