## Let's Develop It

Create a new function called `setDogPhoto`. It needs to:
- Take a `dog` object as an argument
- Find the `photoUrl` property
- Set the `src` of the dogPhotoElement to the url from the `photoUrl` property

Call your function and give it the first object in your `dogs` array as an argument.
