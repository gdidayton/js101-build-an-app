## IDs vs Classes

IDs and Classes are two common methods of identifying DOM nodes

**ID** - Should only apply to one element on a webpage, i.e., you might have an id of `banner` on your webpage's banner.

**Class** - Lots of elements can have the same class, i.e., There can be many elements with a `warning` class on one webpage.
