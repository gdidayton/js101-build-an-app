## Events

An **[event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)** is an object that is sent when actions take place on your webpage, most often when a user interacts with your webpage.

For example, JavaScript creates an event when a user clicks an element.

```
element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  // code to be executed when user clicks
});
```
