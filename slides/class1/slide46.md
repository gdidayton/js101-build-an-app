## Let's Develop It

  - Go to your app in CodePen
  - You should already have a string variable with your dog's name
  - Create a number variable with your dog's age
  - Create a string variable that combines the two, like `Casey, age 14`
  - Print it to your console
  - BONUS: Calculate how old your dog is in human years
