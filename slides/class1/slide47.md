## Let's Develop It

Here is what your code should look like:

```
const dogName = 'Casey';
const dogAge = '14';

const dogNameAndAge = `${dogName}, age ${dogAge}`;

console.log(dogNameAndAge);
```

And for the bonus...

```
const dogYears = dogAge * 7;

console.log(`Casey is ${dogYears} old in dog years`);
```
