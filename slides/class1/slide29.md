## Declaring a Variable

There are three ways to declare a variable in JavaScript:
  - **var**: This is the classic way to declare a variable of any type. It is not used much anymore.
  - **const**: `const` variables remain _constant_. Once you assign them a value, you cannot change it.
  - **let**: `let` variables are allowed to be assigned different values.
