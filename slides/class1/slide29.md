## Declaring a Variable

There are three ways to declare a variable in JavaScript:
  - **var**: This is the classic way to declare a variable of any type. It is not used much anymore.
  - **const**: `const` variables, for the most part, remain _constant_. It cannot be reassigned a different value and it cannot be re-declared. If its value is an array or an object, however, you can add to, remove from, or rearrange its contents
  - **let**: `let` variables are allowed to be assigned different values.
