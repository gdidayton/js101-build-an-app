## Naming Variables

  - The variable name is case-sensitive.
  - A new variable should have a unique name.
  - Variable names need to start with a letter, `$`, or `_`.
  - Avoid [reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words).
  - Choose clarity and meaning for humans to read later.
