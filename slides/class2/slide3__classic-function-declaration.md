## Declaring Functions

There are a couple of different ways to declare a function... but both involve giving the function a name and including all the code for the function inside curly braces.

This is the classic way:

```
function dogFacts() {
  console.log('Dogs can smell your feelings');
  console.log('Dogs only have sweat glands in their paws');
}
```
